VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
        use Lingua::Boolean;
        print "Do it? ";
        chomp(my $response = <>);
        if ( boolean $response ) {   # YES, y, OK, 1...
            print "OK, doing it.\n";
        }
        else {                      # no, N, 0...
            print "OK, not doing it.\n";
        }

        # Once more, with feeling
        print "Fait-le? ";
        chomp($response = <>);
        if ( boolean $response, 'fr' ) {    # OUI
            print "OK, on le fait.\n";
        }
        else {                              # non
            print "OK, on ne le fait pas.\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Does that string look like they said "true" or "false"? To know, you
    have to check a lot of things. Lingua::Boolean attempts to do that in a
    single module, and do so for multiple languages.

FUNCTIONS
  import
    Calling "import()" will, obviously, import subs into your namespace. By
    default, Lingua::Boolean imports the sub "boolean()". You can request to
    have "looks_true()", "looks_false()", and "languages()" imported.

  languages
    "languages()" returns the list of languages Lingua::Boolean knows about.

  langs
    "langs()" returns the list of language codes Lingua::Boolean knows
    about.

  looks_true
    "looks_true()" tells you whether Lingua::Boolean thinks the thing looks
    true. By default, it uses *en*; pass a language code as the second
    parameter to check another language. Croaks if the language is unknown
    to Lingua::Boolean.

  looks_false
    "looks_false()" tells you whether Lingua::Boolean thinks the thing looks
    false. By default, it uses *en*; pass a language code as the second
    parameter to check another language. Croaks if the language is unknown
    to Lingua::Boolean.

  boolean
    "boolean()" tries to determine if the string "looks_true()" or
    "looks_false()", and returns true or false accordingly. If both tests
    fail, dies. By default, uses *en*; pass a language code as the second
    parameter to check another language. Croaks if the language is unknown
    to Lingua::Boolean.

EXPORTS
    By default, Lingua::Boolean exports "boolean()".
